# Search-Engine


Creating a simple search engine in Java using IntelliJ IDEA with a web crawler involves several steps. Below is a brief description of how you can implement this project:

Set up IntelliJ IDEA:

Open IntelliJ IDEA and create a new Java project.
Set up a project structure with appropriate packages.

Create a Web Crawler:
Use a library like JSoup to facilitate web scraping.
Write a web crawler class that can fetch HTML content from a given URL.
Extract relevant information, such as links or text content, from the HTML.

Indexing:
Create an index to store the information retrieved by the web crawler.
Use a data structure like a HashMap or a database to store the indexed information.
Associate each indexed item with its source URL.

Search Engine Logic:
Implement a search engine class that takes user input and searches the indexed data.
Use a ranking algorithm to determine the relevance of search results. You can consider factors like the frequency of occurrence, proximity of words, etc.
Display the top search results.

User Interface (Optional):
Develop a simple user interface to take user queries and display search results.
You can use JavaFX for a desktop application or create a web-based interface using frameworks like Spring Boot.

Integrate with Javatpoint:
To focus on searches related to javatpoint, you may customize your web crawler to prioritize crawling and indexing content from the Javatpoint website.
Filter search results to show only those relevant to Javatpoint.

Testing:
Test your search engine with different queries to ensure accurate and relevant results.
Handle edge cases and errors gracefully.

Optimization and Improvements:
Optimize your code for performance and efficiency.
Explore ways to enhance the ranking algorithm for better search results.
Remember to adhere to ethical web scraping practices and respect the terms of service of the websites you are crawling.

The basic UI of the project is as follows:
